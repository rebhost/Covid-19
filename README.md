# Covid-19
An exploratory analysis of confirmed cases and deaths related to the coronavirus (Project for Career Foundry).

"If there is an increase in confirmed covid cases, then there will be more covid-related deaths"

Using open-source data, Excel, Python and Tableau, this analysis is looking at:
1.	How the virus has spread across the world
2.	The country that has had the most cases and deaths
3.	The peak of covid cases in this country
4.	The different regions in this country and how it is affected by the virus

Data source: “Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset” Accessed from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset on December 15th, 2021.

Summary of findings: 
1. The virus has spread very unevenly across the world, with most cases and deaths in the US from January 2020 -  May 2021.
2. There was a strong correlation between increased cases and deaths in the US.
3. California, Texas, Florida and New York are most affected by the virus. 

Next steps for further analysis:
1. More recent cases and deaths should be investigated to see if there is a difference between the countries.
2. Look at the effects of the different variants on deaths and hospitalizations.
3. Compare vaccinated versus non-vaccinated, as well as the effect of the different types of vaccines. 

Limitations:
1. The data relies on reported numbers from each government.
2. The different sizes of populations were not taken into consideration.
3. The data stopped May 2021, and do not represent the current situation.
